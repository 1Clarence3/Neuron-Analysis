# Neuron-Square-Analysis
The computer traces a neuron and inputs data such as number of nodes and the layer of each node into Data.txt. A graphical analysis is used to find the longest radius from the soma by drawing radial circles and determining if they intersect with a neuron branch. After this length is drawn, the midpoint is found and the longest perpendicular line from that point to the tip of any branch on a neuron is found. These represent the "length" and "width" of a neron, respectively.
